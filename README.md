# Oracle Monitor (Multi-Tenant)

The Oracle Database Monitoring Tool is a utility designed to help database administrators (DBAs) and system administrators monitor and manage various aspects of an Oracle database. This tool supports multiple users, each monitoring their own set of Oracle databases, and provides insights into database health and performance.

## Features

The tool offers a range of monitoring capabilities, including:

*   **User Accounts:** Secure registration and login for multiple users.
*   **Connection Management:** Users can securely store and manage connection profiles for multiple Oracle databases. Oracle passwords are stored encrypted.
*   **SGA Monitoring:** Track System Global Area (SGA) usage with graphical representation and alerts for high-consumption SQL.
*   **Tablespace Utilization:** Monitor space usage, daily growth (average), and estimated remaining days for tablespaces, with charts.
*   **RMAN Backup Monitoring:**
    *   View RMAN backup job history.
    *   Initiate RMAN backups (Full, Tablespace) through a secured mechanism using PL/SQL procedures.
*   **User SQL Monitoring:** View SQL statements executed by database users.
*   **Logs Monitor:** Check status of redo log groups, members, log mode, and average log switch time.
*   **Performance Dashboard:**
    *   Key Performance Ratios (Buffer Cache Hit, Library Cache Hit, Dictionary Cache Hit, Latch Hit) with gauge charts.
    *   Call Rates (User Calls/sec, Commits/sec, Rollbacks/sec).
    *   Top N SQL Summary with bar chart (configurable metric and N).
    *   Top Sessions by Resource with bar chart and table (configurable resource and N).
*   **Active Session Monitoring:** View currently active sessions in the selected Oracle database.
*   **System-Wide Wait Event Monitoring:** Display top N non-idle system wait events by time waited and by number of waits, with charts and a table.

## Setup and Installation

This application is a PHP-based web tool that connects to Oracle databases. Hereâ€™s how to set it up:

**Prerequisites:**

1.  **Web Server:** A web server like Apache or Nginx with PHP support.
    *   PHP version 7.4 or higher recommended.
    *   Required PHP extensions:
        *   `pdo_sqlite` (for the application's own user database).
        *   `oci8` (for connecting to Oracle databases).
        *   `openssl` (for encrypting/decrypting Oracle passwords).
2.  **Oracle Instant Client (or full client):** Must be installed on the server where the PHP application is hosted. Ensure its `PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (on Linux) or system `PATH` (on Windows) are configured correctly so PHP can find the OCI libraries.
3.  **Writable `app_data` directory:** The application needs to create an SQLite database file. The `app_data/` directory (in the project root) must be writable by the web server user.
4.  **Git:** To clone the repository.

**Installation Steps:**

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```

2.  **Configure Web Server:**
    *   Point your web server's document root to the `Frontend/` directory of the cloned repository.
    *   Ensure appropriate permissions are set for the web server user to read files.
    *   For Apache, ensure `AllowOverride All` is set for the directory if using `.htaccess` for security (e.g., to protect `app_data`).

3.  **Initialize Application Database:**
    *   The application uses an SQLite database to store user accounts and their encrypted Oracle database connection profiles.
    *   Run the initialization script from your server's command line:
        ```bash
        php server/initialize_app_db.php
        ```
    *   This will create `app_data/monitoring_tool.sqlite` and set up the necessary tables.
    *   **Security:** Ensure the `app_data/` directory and the `monitoring_tool.sqlite` file are NOT directly accessible via the web. The `initialize_app_db.php` script attempts to create an `.htaccess` file in `app_data/` for Apache servers to deny direct access. Verify this or implement equivalent protection for your web server.

4.  **Configure Encryption Key:**
    *   The application encrypts Oracle database passwords stored in its SQLite database. A secure encryption key is required.
    *   Rename `server/config.php.placeholder` to `server/config.php`.
    *   Edit `server/config.php` and set a strong, 32-byte `ENCRYPTION_KEY`. You can generate one using:
        ```php
        // Run this PHP code snippet once to generate a key:
        // echo base64_encode(random_bytes(32));
        ```
        Place the non-base64 encoded 32-byte string in the `define('ENCRYPTION_KEY', 'your-32-byte-secret-encryption-key');` line.
        Alternatively, use the base64 encoded key with `base64_decode()`:
        `define('ENCRYPTION_KEY', base64_decode('YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_32_BYTE_KEY_HERE'));`
    *   **CRITICAL:** Protect `server/config.php`. Do NOT commit it to version control if it contains the actual key. Ensure it's readable by the web server user but not publicly accessible. In a production cloud environment (like AWS), this key should be managed via a secrets manager (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager) and injected as an environment variable.

5.  **Prepare Target Oracle Databases:**
    *   For each Oracle database you intend to monitor with this tool, you need to run the SQL scripts provided in `Database/Script.sql`.
    *   This script creates necessary PL/SQL functions, procedures, views, and one table (`job_SGA_Table`) that the monitoring tool uses to query Oracle performance data.
    *   Connect to your target Oracle database as a user with privileges to create these objects (e.g., a DBA account or a dedicated schema owner with appropriate grants).
    *   Execute all statements in `Database/Script.sql`.
    *   **Note on Privileges:** The Oracle user whose credentials will be used by the monitoring tool to connect to this target database needs `SELECT` privileges on the `V$` views, `DBA_` views, and other objects queried by the functions/views in `Script.sql`. It will also need `EXECUTE` privileges on the created procedures (like RMAN backup procedures). For simplicity, the tool often assumes SYSDBA-like privileges for the monitoring connection, but a dedicated, less-privileged monitoring user is highly recommended for production use. You would need to grant specific privileges to such a user.

6.  **Access the Application:**
    *   Open your web browser and navigate to the URL where you've hosted the `Frontend/` directory. You should see the application login page.

## How to Use

1.  **Register an Application Account:**
    *   Navigate to the application's main page (e.g., `http://yourserver/path/to/Frontend/`).
    *   Click on "Create an Account" (or navigate to `register.php`).
    *   Fill in your desired username, email, and a strong password for the *monitoring tool itself*. This is NOT your Oracle database password.
    *   Click "Register".

2.  **Login to the Application:**
    *   Go to the main page (`index.html` or `index.php`).
    *   Enter the application username and password you just registered.
    *   Click "Login". You will be redirected to the Menu page.

3.  **Manage Oracle Database Connection Profiles:**
    *   On the Menu page, you'll see a link "Manage Connections" (usually in the bar at the top). Click it, or navigate directly to `manage_connections.php`.
    *   This page allows you to add connection profiles for each Oracle database you want to monitor.
    *   **Add a Profile:**
        *   **Profile Name:** A friendly name for your reference (e.g., "Production CRM DB", "Dev Test Instance").
        *   **Hostname or IP Address:** The server where your Oracle database is running.
        *   **Port:** The TNS listener port (usually 1521).
        *   **Service Name (or SID):** The service name or SID of your Oracle database.
        *   **Oracle Username:** The username for connecting to *your Oracle database*. This user needs the privileges mentioned in the "Prepare Target Oracle Databases" setup step.
        *   **Oracle Password:** The password for the Oracle username. This will be encrypted before being stored by the application.
        *   Click "Add Connection".
    *   You can add multiple profiles. They will be listed on this page. You can also delete profiles from here.

4.  **Select Active Oracle Database for Monitoring:**
    *   Go to the Menu page (`menu.php`).
    *   At the top, you'll see a dropdown labeled "Active Oracle DB:".
    *   Select one of your saved connection profiles from this dropdown.
    *   The "Currently Monitoring:" status will update. This selection is stored in your session and will be used by all monitoring pages.

5.  **Use Monitoring Features:**
    *   From the Menu page, click on any of the available monitoring sections (e.g., "SGA Monitor", "Tablespace", "Performance Dashboard", "RMAN", etc.).
    *   The data displayed will be fetched from the Oracle database profile you currently have selected as active.
    *   If no profile is selected, or if there's an issue connecting to the selected Oracle database, the monitoring pages will display an error message prompting you to select a valid profile.

6.  **Logout:**
    *   When finished, click the "Logout" link (usually in the header on the Menu page or other pages) to securely end your application session.

## Running Tests

This project includes PHPUnit tests for backend functionality.

**Prerequisites for Testing:**

1.  **Composer:** Ensure Composer is installed globally or available in your PHP environment.
2.  **PHPUnit:** Install project development dependencies, including PHPUnit, by running:
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```
    This command should be run in the root directory of the project (where `composer.json` is located).

**Test Configuration:**

1.  **Encryption Key for Tests:**
    *   The tests, especially those involving encryption or database interaction that might trigger encryption (like `ConnectionsHandlerTest`), require an encryption key.
    *   A placeholder environment variable `TEST_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is defined in `phpunit.xml.dist`.
    *   **It is highly recommended to create a `phpunit.xml` file (a copy of `phpunit.xml.dist`) and set a specific, non-production 32-byte key for `TEST_ENCRYPTION_KEY` there.** `phpunit.xml` is typically gitignored.
        ```xml
        <!-- phpunit.xml -->
        <php>
            <env name="TEST_ENCRYPTION_KEY" value="YourDedicated32ByteTestKey12345"/>
        </php>
        ```
    *   Alternatively, you can set this as an actual environment variable in your testing system.
    *   The `encryption_helper.php` has a development fallback key, but tests are more reliable if a specific test key is configured.

2.  **Test Database (for Integration Tests):**
    *   Integration tests (like `RegistrationHandlerTest`, `LoginHandlerTest`, `ConnectionsHandlerTest`) are designed to run against an **in-memory SQLite database** to avoid affecting your development or production application database.
    *   For these tests to correctly use the in-memory database, the `server/app_db_connection.php` script needs to be aware of the testing environment. The tests attempt to use a global variable (`$GLOBALS['TEST_PDO_OVERRIDE']`) to inject the test PDO instance. This requires a modification to `server/app_db_connection.php` similar to this for the tests to fully work as intended with the database:
        ```php
        // server/app_db_connection.php (modified for testability)
        function getAppDbConnection() {
            if (isset($GLOBALS['TEST_PDO_OVERRIDE']) && $GLOBALS['TEST_PDO_OVERRIDE'] instanceof \PDO) {
                return $GLOBALS['TEST_PDO_OVERRIDE'];
            }
            // ... original SQLite connection logic ...
        }
        ```
    *   Without this modification, the integration tests might attempt to use the actual `app_data/monitoring_tool.sqlite` file, which could lead to test failures or data contamination if not handled carefully. The current tests are written assuming they can control the PDO instance.

**Executing Tests:**

*   **From the project root directory, run:**
    ```bash
    composer test
    ```
    (This uses the script defined in `composer.json`)
*   **Or directly using the PHPUnit executable (if in your PATH or from `vendor/bin`):**
    ```bash
    ./vendor/bin/phpunit
    ```
    Or:
    ```bash
    phpunit
    ```

**Interpreting Test Results:**

*   PHPUnit will output the results of the tests, showing successes, failures, errors, and skipped tests.
*   **Skipped Tests:** Some integration tests (for `RegistrationHandlerTest` and `LoginHandlerTest`) are currently marked as skipped (`$this->markTestSkipped(...)`). This is because fully testing procedural scripts that involve `header()` redirects and `exit()` calls directly within PHPUnit requires more advanced setup (like PHPUnit's `@runInSeparateProcess` annotation per test, or significant refactoring of those handler scripts into more testable units). The comments in those test files provide more details. The `ConnectionsHandlerTest` is more complete as it tests JSON API-like behavior.

**Code Coverage (Optional):**

*   If you have Xdebug or PCOV installed and configured for PHP, you can generate a code coverage report. The `phpunit.xml.dist` is configured to include files from the `server/` directory.
*   To generate an HTML coverage report, you might run:
    ```bash
    ./vendor/bin/phpunit --coverage-html coverage-report
    ```
    The report will be generated in the `coverage-report/` directory.

## Deploying to an Ubuntu Server for Public Access

This guide provides steps to deploy the Oracle Monitor application on an Ubuntu server and make it publicly accessible.

**Prerequisites:**

*   An Ubuntu server (e.g., an AWS EC2 instance, VPS, or dedicated server).
*   Root or sudo access to the server.
*   A domain name (e.g., `your-oracle-monitor.com`) pointed to your server's public IP address.
*   Familiarity with basic Linux commands and server administration.

**1. Server Setup & PHP Installation:**

*   **Update System:**
    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
    ```
*   **Install Web Server (Apache or Nginx):**
    *   **Apache:**
        ```bash
        sudo apt install apache2 -y
        sudo systemctl enable apache2
        sudo systemctl start apache2
        # Configure Apache virtual host (see step 4)
        ```
    *   **Nginx:**
        ```bash
        sudo apt install nginx -y
        sudo systemctl enable nginx
        sudo systemctl start nginx
        # Configure Nginx server block (see step 4)
        ```
*   **Install PHP & Required Extensions:**
    The specific PHP version might depend on Ubuntu's repositories or if you add a PPA for newer PHP versions (e.g., `ondrej/php`). Assuming PHP 8.1:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install php8.1 php8.1-fpm php8.1-cli php8.1-common php8.1-sqlite3 php8.1-oci8 php8.1-openssl php8.1-xml php8.1-mbstring php8.1-ctype php8.1-json php8.1-bcmath php8.1-tokenizer -y
    ```
    *   If using Apache with `mod_php`, install `libapache2-mod-php8.1`. If using Nginx or Apache with PHP-FPM, `php8.1-fpm` is key.
    *   Enable PHP extensions if necessary (e.g., `sudo phpenmod pdo_sqlite oci8 openssl`).

**2. Install Oracle Instant Client:**

*   Go to the [Oracle Instant Client Downloads page](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/instant-client/linux-x86-64-downloads.html).
*   Download the "Basic" or "Basic Light" package and the "SDK" package for your server's architecture (usually x86-64). You might also need the "SQL*Plus" package for testing.
    *   Example for 19c (versions may vary, get the latest compatible ones):
        *   `instantclient-basic-linux.x64-19.x.x.x.x.zip`
        *   `instantclient-sdk-linux.x64-19.x.x.x.x.zip`
*   **Install on Server:**
    ```bash
    # Example directory
    sudo mkdir -p /opt/oracle
    cd /opt/oracle
    # Assuming you've uploaded the zips here
    sudo unzip instantclient-basic-linux.x64-*.zip
    sudo unzip instantclient-sdk-linux.x64-*.zip
    # This creates a directory like /opt/oracle/instantclient_19_XX
    export ORACLE_CLIENT_DIR=/opt/oracle/instantclient_19_XX # Adjust version
    ```
*   **Configure Dynamic Linker:**
    ```bash
    echo $ORACLE_CLIENT_DIR | sudo tee /etc/ld.so.conf.d/oracle-instantclient.conf
    sudo ldconfig
    ```
*   **Set Environment Variables (for web server & CLI PHP):**
    *   These need to be available to the PHP process run by your web server. This can be tricky.
    *   For Apache with `mod_php`, you might set them in `/etc/apache2/envvars`.
    *   For PHP-FPM, you might set them in the FPM pool configuration file (e.g., `/etc/php/8.1/fpm/pool.d/www.conf` by adding `env[LD_LIBRARY_PATH] = ...`).
    *   Example variables:
        ```bash
        # Add to the relevant env file (e.g., /etc/apache2/envvars or PHP-FPM pool config)
        export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ORACLE_CLIENT_DIR:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
        export ORACLE_HOME=$ORACLE_CLIENT_DIR # OCI8 might sometimes look for ORACLE_HOME
        # For some setups TNS_ADMIN might be needed if you use tnsnames.ora
        # export TNS_ADMIN=/path/to/your/tnsnames/directory
        ```
    *   **Restart Web Server and PHP-FPM** after setting environment variables:
        ```bash
        sudo systemctl restart apache2 # or nginx
        sudo systemctl restart php8.1-fpm # if using PHP-FPM
        ```
    *   Verify OCI8 is loaded in PHP: create a `phpinfo.php` file in your web root with `<?php phpinfo(); ?>` and check the OCI8 section.

**3. Deploy Application Code:**

*   Follow steps 1, 3, 4, and 5 from the "Setup and Installation" section above (Clone repository, Initialize App DB, Configure Encryption Key, Prepare Target Oracle DBs).
*   Place the application code in the directory designated by your web server configuration (e.g., `/var/www/your-oracle-monitor.com`).
*   **Permissions:** Ensure the web server user (e.g., `www-data` for Apache/Nginx on Debian/Ubuntu) has:
    *   Read access to the application files (especially `Frontend/` and `server/`).
    *   Write access to the `app_data/` directory to create and manage the `monitoring_tool.sqlite` database.
    ```bash
    sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/your-oracle-monitor.com
    sudo find /var/www/your-oracle-monitor.com -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
    sudo find /var/www/your-oracle-monitor.com -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
    sudo chmod -R 775 /var/www/your-oracle-monitor.com/app_data # Ensure web server can write here
    ```

**4. Configure Web Server for Public Access:**

*   **Apache Virtual Host:**
    Create a new Apache configuration file (e.g., `/etc/apache2/sites-available/your-oracle-monitor.com.conf`):
    ```apache
    <VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerAdmin webmaster@your-oracle-monitor.com
        ServerName your-oracle-monitor.com
        # Optional: ServerAlias www.your-oracle-monitor.com

        DocumentRoot /var/www/your-oracle-monitor.com/Frontend
        DirectoryIndex index.php index.html

        <Directory /var/www/your-oracle-monitor.com/Frontend>
            Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
            AllowOverride All # Important for .htaccess if used (e.g., in app_data)
            Require all granted
        </Directory>

        ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/your-oracle-monitor-error.log
        CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/your-oracle-monitor-access.log combined

        # PHP-FPM Configuration (if not using mod_php)
        # <FilesMatch \.php$>
        #     SetHandler "proxy:unix:/run/php/php8.1-fpm.sock|fcgi://localhost/"
        # </FilesMatch>
    </VirtualHost>
    ```
    Enable the site and rewrite module:
    ```bash
    sudo a2ensite your-oracle-monitor.com.conf
    sudo a2enmod rewrite
    sudo systemctl restart apache2
    ```

*   **Nginx Server Block:**
    Create a new Nginx configuration file (e.g., `/etc/nginx/sites-available/your-oracle-monitor.com`):
    ```nginx
    server {
        listen 80;
        listen [::]:80;

        server_name your-oracle-monitor.com; # Add www.your-oracle-monitor.com if needed
        root /var/www/your-oracle-monitor.com/Frontend;
        index index.php index.html;

        location / {
            try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
        }

        location ~ \.php$ {
            include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
            fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php8.1-fpm.sock; # Check your PHP-FPM socket path
            # fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
            # include fastcgi_params;
        }

        location ~ /\.ht {
            deny all; # Deny access to .htaccess files if any exist (though Nginx doesn't use them)
        }

        # Protect app_data directory (assuming it's inside project root, adjust path if it's outside web root)
        location /../app_data { # This relative path might need adjustment based on root
             deny all;
             return 404;
        }
        # Better: ensure app_data is outside the DocumentRoot. If it must be inside,
        # and your DocumentRoot is /var/www/your-oracle-monitor.com/Frontend
        # then a location block for /app_data/ would be relative to that root.
        # If app_data is at /var/www/your-oracle-monitor.com/app_data:
        # location /../app_data { deny all; } (from Frontend/../app_data)
        # If you moved app_data outside /var/www, no specific Nginx rule is needed here for it.

        access_log /var/log/nginx/your-oracle-monitor-access.log;
        error_log /var/log/nginx/your-oracle-monitor-error.log;
    }
    ```
    Enable the site by creating a symlink:
    ```bash
    sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/your-oracle-monitor.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
    sudo nginx -t # Test configuration
    sudo systemctl restart nginx
    ```

**5. Install Composer and Dependencies:**
    If not already done during local setup/testing:
    ```bash
    cd /var/www/your-oracle-monitor.com
    # Install Composer if you haven't: https://getcomposer.org/download/
    # php -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer', 'composer-setup.php');"
    # php composer-setup.php --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer
    # php -r "unlink('composer-setup.php');"
    composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader # For production, no dev dependencies
    ```

**6. Configure Firewall:**
    Allow HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) traffic.
    ```bash
    sudo ufw allow 'Apache Full' # or 'Nginx Full'
    # Or more specifically:
    # sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
    # sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
    sudo ufw enable # If not already enabled
    ```

**7. Secure with HTTPS (Let's Encrypt - Recommended):**
    *   Install Certbot:
        ```bash
        sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-apache # For Apache
        # OR
        sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx # For Nginx
        ```
    *   Obtain and install SSL certificate:
        ```bash
        sudo certbot --apache # For Apache
        # OR
        sudo certbot --nginx # For Nginx
        ```
        Follow the prompts. Certbot will automatically update your web server configuration for HTTPS and set up auto-renewal.

**8. Final Checks:**
    *   Ensure your domain's DNS records point to your server's public IP.
    *   Test accessing the application via `http://your-oracle-monitor.com` and then `https://your-oracle-monitor.com`.
    *   Try registering a user, adding a DB connection profile, and monitoring an Oracle database that you have prepared with `Database/Script.sql` and for which the server has network access.

**Important Security Considerations for Public Access:**

*   **HTTPS is a must.**
*   **Strong Encryption Key:** The `ENCRYPTION_KEY` in `server/config.php` must be very strong and kept secret. Consider loading it from an environment variable set outside the codebase or from a secrets management service if on a cloud platform like AWS.
*   **Application Database Security:** The `app_data/` directory and `monitoring_tool.sqlite` file must *not* be publicly accessible via the web. The web server configurations above include attempts to block access, but verify this. Placing `app_data` outside the web server's document root is the most secure.
*   **PHP Configuration:** Harden your PHP configuration (e.g., disable `expose_php`, set appropriate `memory_limit`, `upload_max_filesize`, `post_max_size`, configure `error_reporting` for production).
*   **Regular Updates:** Keep your server, PHP, web server, and all packages updated.
*   **Firewall:** Only open necessary ports.
*   **Input Validation & Output Escaping:** The application should diligently validate all user inputs and escape all outputs to prevent XSS and other injection attacks. The current implementation has basic escaping in places but would need a thorough review for a public-facing service.
*   **Rate Limiting & Brute-Force Protection:** Consider implementing measures against login brute-force attacks.
*   **Oracle User Privileges:** Ensure the Oracle users configured by your application users have the minimum necessary privileges on their target databases. Avoid using SYSDBA or highly privileged accounts if possible.
