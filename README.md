# Oracle_Monitor_SGA_TableSpce

The Oracle Database Monitoring Tool is a utility designed to help database administrators (DBAs) and system administrators monitor and manage various aspects of an Oracle database, including System Global Area (SGA) usage, tablespace utilization, and Recovery Manager (RMAN) backups. This tool provides insights into the health and performance of the Oracle database, allowing for proactive management and issue resolution.

Features
SGA Monitoring: Keep track of the System Global Area (SGA) usage, including shared pool, buffer cache, and other memory components. Identify potential memory-related performance bottlenecks.

Tablespace Utilization: Monitor the space utilization of different tablespaces within the database. Receive alerts when tablespaces are running low on space to prevent out-of-space errors.

RMAN Backup Status: Check the status of RMAN backups, including full, incremental, and archived logs backups. Ensure that your database backups are up-to-date and available for disaster recover.

Customizable Dashboards: Create personalized dashboards that display the specific metrics and information you need at a glance. Customize charts, graphs, and tables based on your monitoring priorities.

Historical Data Analysis: Store historical monitoring data to analyze trends and patterns over time. This information can help in capacity planning and identifying long-term performance issues.
